## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
all of them. used lots of documentation in this weeks checkpoint as well as partner coding using the driver/navigator primciple and changing positions every so often. 
also user experience which who can do what regarding comments tickets evetns etc.

2. What went well this week?
enjoyed the extra time in the class room to ask questions on things i got stuck on. getting the extra help in small things that can ruin a whole function.

3. What would you do differently?
i would have spent more time on styling as i went along to my own style rather than saving it all to the very end.
