## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

it was very fast paced really drove me to my limits. after getting the final my concerns are trying to find and change refference to fit the situation, ive spent alot of time already and have realized i manage my time best by walking away or moving from the bck end to the frot end when stuck on something specific. ive enjoyed the struggle as well as the frindly environment.
