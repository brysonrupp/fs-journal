2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
suscribe, unsuscribe, and broadcast.
3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
