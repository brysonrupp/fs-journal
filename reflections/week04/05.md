# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

the continued use and extra practice on the mvc pattern

shocked on how hard it can be to trouble shoot errors.

trouble shooting errors. getting everything to work in sync. everything on checkpoint was fine until my listeners stopped working. then when adding into the appstate causes my other listenings to not work correctly.

the increased understanding.... as frustrated as i am right now. the struggle is fun and terrible at the same time.
