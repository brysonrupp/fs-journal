## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums are strongly typed constants. They are essentially unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values. In the CSharp tradition, they are strongly typed. That means an enum of one type may not be implicitly assigned to an enum of another type, though the underlying value of their members is the same. Along the same lines, integral types and enums are not implicitly interchangeable. All assignments between different enum types and integral types require an explicit cast.
2. How can you modify an Enum?
by setting the value of a enum value and calling it. 
3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
i havent used them, but could use them for grabbing specific stuff you may ony need in a certain situation but not in another.
